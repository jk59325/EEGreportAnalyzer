Last Seizure: 05/18/08    CONDITIONS OF RECORDING: 24 hour video-EEG acquired with a digital Nihon-Kohden EEG machine, 24 channels, with Standard International System 10-20 electrode placements, eye movement leads, and an EKG lead. Machine detection was used for spikes, rhythmical events and possible seizures. These and other continuous segments of the EEG were then scanned by attending electroencephalographers.   Findings   The overall voltage was normal. The tracing was variable, reactive and continuous. The basic rhythm of medium voltage, at 9 to 10/second, was present over the parietal-occipital regions. During maximal alertness, the record showed alpha, and moderate amount of diffuse low-voltage fast (> 13/sec) activity. Delta (<4/sec) activity during wakefulness was absent. A normal variant of lambda waves was seen over the occipital regions bilaterally at times appeared in runs. There was also right sided Mu rhythm. Sleep features included fronto-central maximal slowing, positive occipital sharp transients of sleep (POSTS), asymmetric vertex waves (shifting to the right), bilateral 12-14 per second sleep spindles, and K complexes. A normal variant of wicket spikes was present bilaterally left more than right.

Medication: Dilantin.     CONDITIONS OF RECORDING: The recording was performed with a digital EEG machine, 24 channels, with Standard International 10-20 System electrode placements, eye movement leads, and an EKG lead.    Findings     Baseline EEG: The overall voltage was normal. The tracing was variable, symmetric and continuous. The posterior basic rhythm of medium voltage, at 10-11/ second, was present over the parietal-occipital regions bilaterally. Reactivity to eye opening and closure was appropriate. During maximal alertness, the record showed alpha, negligible amount of medium voltage theta activity, and moderate amount of diffuse low-voltage fast (> 13/sec) activity. Delta (<4/sec) activity during wakefulness was absent. During drowsiness and light sleep there was additional diffuse, but bifronto-central maximal slowing. Sleep features included POSTS only.     There are two occasions of low amplitude, negative sharp waveforms with simple morphology at the occipital poles left > right side, that do not disturb the background and occur without aftergoing slow waves. They appear while patient is drifting into sleep, and after the disappearance of her PDR. These do not meet adequate criteria for epileptiform discharges, and are of unclear diagnostic significance. Several other positive waveforms were present on this record in the same distribution, more consistent with lambda waves (positive), however, the patient was not reading or clearly visually fixating on an object while present.           (Double banana montage; left over right, lateral chains at top.)    The single channel EKG showed regular heart rhythm.    IMPRESS ON   This EEG is normal during wakefulness and light sleep,  without evidence of unequivocal epileptiform activity. No seizures are present.    Comments   Absence of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy or seizures.

Three different types of events were captured and were consistent with nonepileptic events, clinically and electrographically, lacking any epileptiform-like activity or pattern. There was no evidence of interictal epileptiform activity.  Comments  Absence of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy or seizures. The focal slowing can be related to the reported history of traumatic brain injury, or other etiologies for focal cerebral dysfunction, including seizure from focal onset. Diffuse slowing is non-specific finding of encephalopathy.  These findings and their significance will be communicated directly to the treating physicians. Further recording with further tapering AEDs might  help in confirming the diagnosis of epileptic events, if the EEG was able to capture robust epileptic event or interictal epileptiform discharges.

Machine detection was used for spikes, rhythmical events and possible seizures. These and other continuous segments of the EEG were then scanned by attending electroencephalographers.  Findings  Baseline EEG:  The background is profoundly low in amplitude. The EEG reading at 2uV showed minimal activity, which is not actual brain activity as it is more noise artifact. No variability or reactivity to stimulation was present. There was no occipital dominant rhythm. No normal sleep features were present.  Neurobehavioral Events  Multiple episodes of stimulation induced rhythmical jaw movements and extensor posturing were recorded. No epileptiform EEG correlates were present.  Comments  Electrocerebral silence (no cerebral potentials over 2 uV)  is consistent with brain death but also can be seen with severe hypothermia, sedating or anesthetic medications and, rarely, EEG technical failure.

Referring dept or MD: Fisher, Robert S., MD    History: 44 year old right handed female with a history of right temporal oligodendroglioma s/p resection in 1998 and symptomatic localization-related epilepsy, now with neurobehavioral events concerning for seizure.   Meds: hydrocodone, fentanyl, escitalopram, dexamethasone.    CONDITIONS OF RECORDING: The recording was performed with a digital EEG machine, 88 channels, including 4 depth electrodes:  1. L insula (LINS) 12 contact electrode with black markings (box #16)   2. L hippocampus (LHIP) 8 contact electrode with green markings (box #10)   3. R amygdala (RAMY) 8 contact electrode with purple markings (box # 33)   4. R hippocampus (RHIP) 10 contact electrode (lateral contacts in this chain are near the right lateral temporal neocortex) with red markings (box #6)    Baseline EEG  The record showed the typical mixed pattern of intracranial EEG, with polymorphic delta, theta, and alpha activity, including an intermittent, sharply contoured alpha rhythm over the right lateral temporal region in the range of 9-10 Hz during maximal wakefulness (i.e. the \"third rhythm\").    Interictal Activity   There were frequent epileptiform spikes with phase reversal or maximum at RHIP 1- 2, 7-8 and 8-9 and R AMY 1-2 and 2-3. R amygdala spikes appeared more frequently than the R hippocampal (R Hip 1-2) spikes and led the latter by a short time period. Rare L hippocampal spikes are also present (L Hip 1-3).  Spikes would occasionally occur in brief bursts lasting 1-2 seconds.     Neurobehavioral Events   9/6/12 at 11:40:38   The patient develops one of her typical crying spells as documented in the brain stimulation procedure note.     9/6/12 9:35:28  The patient reports that she suddenly lost her train of thought shorly prior to the button push. There are no clear electrographic changes. A burst of spikes in the deep R hippocampal electrodes is present shortly prior to the push button at 9:35:21 but these bursts are not infrequent throughout her record without any associated symptoms.     9/5/12 17:50  The patient is watching tv and does not have any clinical correlate. Rhythmic alpha frequency activity is noted in R Hip 7-9 electrodes and gradually begins to slow. Similar activity in the R Hip 1-2 electrodes also appears at a similar frequency with a mild delay. The event ends at 17:50:04.    9/5/12 14:34:48   Crying spell. No electrographic change. The event starts with her asking the EEG safety tech if there is anything abnormal on her EEG and stating that something is happening before she begins to cry. No clear electrographic changes.     9/5/12 12:46:12  Rhythmic alpha frequency activity builds in the R Hip 1-2 and R Hip 7-9. This gradually slows before progressing to spiking in the alpha range.

A norma mu rhythm was seen most prominently in electrodes ALG 25-26, 17-18, and 9-10. This is reactive to contralateral hand movements. The SPG electrodes demonstrate a normal alpha rhythm that is reactive to eye opening and closing.     During sleep, there was additional diffuse polymorphic slowing in the record.

Alertness: comatose  Activation: Sensory Stimulation  Indication: Evaluate for seizure activity.  Referring dept or MD: Parvizi, Josef MD.  History: 68 year old woman status post anoxic brain injury with events of rhythmical movements. Meds: Zosyn, Vancomycin. CONDITIONS OF RECORDING: 24 hour video-EEG acquired with a digital Nihon-Kohden EEG machine, 20 channels, with Standard International System 10-20 electrode placements, eye movement leads, and an EKG lead. Machine detection was used for spikes, rhythmical events and possible seizures. These and other continuous segments of the EEG were then scanned by attending electroencephalographers. Findings  Baseline EEG:  The background is profoundly low in amplitude. The EEG reading at 2uV showed minimal activity, which is not actual brain activity as it is more noise artifact. No variability or reactivity to stimulation was present. There was no occipital dominant rhythm. No normal sleep features were present. Neurobehavioral Events  Multiple episodes of stimulation induced rhythmical jaw movements and extensor posturing were recorded. No epileptiform EEG correlates were present. Comments  Electrocerebral silence (no cerebral potentials over 2 uV)  is consistent with brain death but also can be seen with severe hypothermia, sedating or anesthetic medications and, rarely, EEG technical failure. As this was not a dedicated electrocerebral silence (ECS) study intended to conform to ACNS guidelines, this result alone does not confirm brain-death. STUCKERT, ERIKA 11:23 AM 2/19/2009  Epilepsy Fellow; pager#14358. I reviewed the EEG with Dr Stuckert and modified the report where needed, and I agree with the findings reported above.

There was an intermittent poorly formed posterior dominant rhythm at 7-10 per second reactive to eye opening and closing.  There was a moderate amount of diffuse low voltage 15-25/s beta activity and a large amount of diffuse theta slowing 4 to <8/second activity and a moderate amount of delta slowing < 4/second activity during wakefulness.    On the baseline intracranial EEG, there was an admixture of alpha, theta, beta and delta frequencies on the strips and grids.  There was relative suppression of electrodes LG 17-20, 61-64.  There was frequent spikes in most implanted electrodes at baseline and most prominent in AST 2, 4, MST 2, 3 4, 5, PST 1, 2, 4, 5, OCC 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13,14, LG 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 22, 26, 29, 30, 31, 37, 38, 39, 44, 45, 47, 52, 53, 55, 59, VTX 2.  The single channel EKG rhythm monitoring lead showed regular rate and rhythm.    Interictal Activity  There were occasional low amplitude dependent spikes in the bilateral occipital regions with a broad field on scalp EEG.    Neurobehavioral Events   1. 1st Left Hemisphere Injection  25mg pentobarbital were injected into the left internal carotid at 09:57:37 which resulted in increase in bilateral scalp diffuse slowing but also increased diffuse low voltage fast beta activity and some alpha activity beginning at 09:57:44.  This was followed by an increase in rhythmic broad field complex morphology polyphasic spiking activity with overriding fast activity most prominent in the bilateral posterior quadrants at 1-2Hz (generalized, occipitally predominant, periodic discharges + spikes + fast activity = GPD+S+F). Scalp EEG returned to baseline by 10:08:44 before recall testing began.   On intracranial EEG, there was increased higher amplitude rhythmic slowing, copious spiking and intervals of suppression on all strips and  grids immediately after injection and largely resolving by 10:09:05.  There were no seizures identified on EEG during this injection.     2. 1st Right Hemisphere Injection    25mg pentobarbital were injected into the right internal carotid at 10:24:53 a.m. which resulted in focal higher amplitude right hemisphere polymorphic delta slowing at 10:24:53 followed by diffuse slowing on scalp EEG at 10:25:09.  There was no increased occipital spiking from the baseline.  Scalp EEG returned to baseline by 10:34:42.  On intracranial EEG, there was some mild increased in slowing and intermittent spiking but not significantly changed from the baseline recordings.  There were no seizures identified on EEG during this injection.    Impression/comments   1. There were no seizures on EEG during carotid injections.  2.

A geodesic cap of 256 electrodes was applied to the scalp. Electrodes were precisely localized with photographic co-registration and mapped to the MNI standard brain MRI. EEG was recorded for 50 minutes with the patient at rest.   Epileptiform activity was identified and marked by the reader.     BASELINE EEG: EEG was of overall normal voltage, and continuous. In the maximally alert state a clear posterior dominant rhythm was not prominent and the background consistent mainly of theta and alpha activity intermixed with moderate amount of beta activity that was more prominent over the frontal regions.

There are no seizures or epileptiform discharges.    CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Absence of epileptiform discharges does not exclude or negate a clinical diagnosis of seizures or epilepsy.    Patient's event of being frozen was not associated with seizure on EEG.   ________________________________________________________________________    RECORDING:    Continuous EEG acquired with a digital Nihon-Kohden EEG machine, 20 channels, with Standard International System 10-20 electrode placements, and an EKG channel. Machine detection was used for spikes, rhythmical events and possible seizures. EEG was then reviewed by fellow and attending electroencephalographers and technologists.    DESCRIPTION:  Background: The record is continuous, symmetric, variable and reactive, with overall normal voltage. In the maximally wakeful state, the background consists of a posteriorly dominant rhythm at 11 Hz that attenuates appropriately with eye opening. More anteriorly there is an admixture of polymorphic alpha and beta activity.     Drowsiness is indicated by rolling eye movements, slight slowing of the background, and attenuation and fragmentation of the posteriorly dominant rhythm.    Stage I sleep is characterized by vertex sharp waves and positive occipital sharp transients of sleep (POSTS).  Stage II sleep is evidenced by bilateral frontocentral spindles, and K-complexes. There are also periods of delta (slow wave) sleep (characterized by greater than 50% predominant delta activity), as well as REM sleep (characterized by polymorphic alpha activity, absence of myogenic signals, and eye movement related signals in the anterior quadrants).    Focal Slowing:  None.    Interictal Epileptiform Activity:  None.    Ictal Activity: None.    Neurobehavioral Events: On 7/18/2016, 16:50:23, the patient commented she felt an \"event of being frozen\" which was not associated with abnormal activity on the EEG, no seizures, or epileptiform discharges were observed. The EKG showed tachycardia (120bpm, for about 2 minutes) during the event followed by a decrease to 50-60 bpm. Similar episodes of tachycardia were noted at other times of the record as wells without any specific symptoms reported.     EKG:  Reviewed segments of single channel recording shows regular rhythm.   ________________________________________________________________________  Report prepared by:  Stephan Bickel MD,PhD  Epilepsy Fellow  Service Pager 14701      Interpreting Attending Physician Attestation:  I personally reviewed and interpreted the EEG with fellow Dr. Stephan Bickel, modified the report where needed, and I agree with the findings described above.
